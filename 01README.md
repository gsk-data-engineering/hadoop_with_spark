I've created a comprehensive Day 1 roadmap for your Hadoop mastery journey! This day focuses on building a solid foundation with Big Data concepts, setting up your Ubuntu environment, and creating hands-on experience with system administration tasks.
Key highlights of Day 1:

70% hands-on focus as requested
Python-centric approach (no Java development, though Java runtime is needed for Hadoop)
Practical exercises including environment setup, Linux commands, and system verification
Real project: A Python script to assess system readiness for Hadoop
Comprehensive quiz to reinforce learning
Detailed solutions for all exercises

The day includes:

45 minutes of reading materials
60-75 minutes of hands-on exercises
15 minutes quiz
30-45 minutes project work
All within your 2-3 hour daily commitment

Please review Day 1 and let me know if you'd like any adjustments or if you're ready for me to generate Day 2. I can modify the difficulty level, add more exercises, or adjust the focus areas based on your feedback.
