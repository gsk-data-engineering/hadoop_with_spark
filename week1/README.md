I've created a detailed Week 1 study plan that focuses on building a solid foundation in Hadoop. Here's what this week covers:
Key Highlights:

Day 1-2: Environment setup and HDFS mastery
Day 3: Python integration with Hadoop
Day 4-5: MapReduce programming and YARN understanding
Weekend: Hands-on project with real web log analysis

Learning Approach:

Each day has clear learning objectives and hands-on exercises
Heavy emphasis on practical work without providing actual code
Progressive complexity building from basics to integration
Real-world project on weekend to consolidate learning

Time Management:

Weekdays: 2-3 hours focused learning
Weekend: 4-5 hours each day for comprehensive project work
Total: ~22-25 hours for Week 1

The plan includes specific outcomes you should achieve each day, so you can track your progress effectively. Each exercise is designed to build practical skills you'll use in real data engineering scenarios.
Please confirm if this Week 1 plan looks good to you, and I'll create the detailed Day 1 document to get you started!
